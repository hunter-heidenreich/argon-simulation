> **Reproducing the foundations of molecular dynamics simulation**

A toolkit for reproducing the results from **Aneesur Rahman's 1964 paper** *"Correlations in the Motion of Atoms in Liquid Argon"* ([Physical Review 136, A405](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.136.A405)). This seminal work founded the field of molecular dynamics simulation by demonstrating its power to reveal microscopic, time-dependent behavior in liquids.

## 🔬 About Rahman's 1964 Paper

Rahman's paper was revolutionary for several reasons:

- **First molecular dynamics simulation** of a realistic liquid system (864 argon atoms)
- **Introduction of periodic boundary conditions** to simulate bulk behavior
- **Direct calculation of time-correlation functions** from atomic trajectories
- **Validation of theoretical models** through computational "experiments"
- **Discovery of complex atomic motion** including velocity "back-scattering" effects

The simulation revealed that liquid argon atoms don't undergo simple Brownian motion, but instead show complex dynamics including temporary "caging" by neighbors and subsequent escape—insights impossible to obtain from experiment alone.
